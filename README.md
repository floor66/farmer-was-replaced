# The Farmer Was Replaced

Assorted code I wrote for the game "The Farmer Was Replaced"

Not complete with all crops yet (I spent a lot of time focussing on maze solving strategies)

Note: this game uses Python but not all Python language features (e.g. Classes) are available, so sometimes hacks/workarounds are required
